***Web app Created by Usman Ashraf - 40096834***

To run app, run levinux and pull GIT clone from: 
https://github.com/UAshraf123/CW2.git

Go into the src folder via the following linux command: 

cd/home/tc/CW2/src

Within this directory, you will find python script "index.py"

To run the script/webapp, type the following: 

python index.py

Once the levenix has restarted the app and given you the debugger pin, go into 
your browser and enter the url: http://localhost:5000

This will open the web app.

To close everything down, press CTRL+C within levenix, and shut down levenix
safely by typing "sudo poweroff".
